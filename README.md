# Identify_Phishing_Emails
Project implements a phishing detection system using machine learning algorithms, specifically Random Forest and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The goal is to accurately identify phishing websites that attempt to deceive users into providing sensitive information.

Technologies Used:
Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)

The dataset used in this project is available in Kaggle two features namely Email Text and Email Type. The Email Text specifies the email body and the Email Type specifies the type of email whether it is Phishing or Safe.

Results
The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of approximately 92%, outperforming the SVM model, which demonstrated a lower accuracy. The results indicate that Random Forest is more effective for phishing detection tasks compared to SVM in this context.
